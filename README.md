# Helpdesk simulator game

The original helpdesk simulator is a simple, text-based adventure game
where you play as a new, bright-eyed IT helpdesk technician. As a new
employee at Incompecorp, your job is to help customers with their IT
issues, avoid disaster and improve your skills one ticket at a time.

When you're a high enough level, you'll be promoted to an IT manager.
It's then up to you to hire new technicians and manage the IT helpdesk
tickets, while training your new hires, to achieve the best outcome
possible.

## Quick start

1. Run helpdesk to begin.

2. You have the option of completing a short tutorial or jumping
   straight to the action.

3. The first time it runs, helpdesk will write default data to the  
   data directory. These are:

   - disasters.json for the potential disasters that could occur
   - issues.json for the issues that people may encounter
   - names.json for the names of the people you interact with
   - options.json for the options available when solving an issue

4. Advanced users may wish to edit these data files. You can do this
   directly with any programme capable of editing json data.

5. Enjoy your helpdesk adventure!
